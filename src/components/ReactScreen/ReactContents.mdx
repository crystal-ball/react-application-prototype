# React conventions 📝

- **Working with dependency arrays:** Consider structures used in dependency arrays
  immutable and use `immer` to update them, this lets you include the structures in
  dependency arrays for hooks without having to perform any serialization.
- **Component definitions:** Define components with arrow fns, it makes converting them to
  TS simple

### Component template

```tsx
export function Example({ status }: ExampleProps): JSX.Element {
  return {
    <div>This example component is {status} rad</div>
  }
}

type ExampleProps {
  /** Indicator of how rad this component is */
  status: 'pretty' | 'hecka'
}
```
