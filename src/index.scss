/*
 * 🔮 Projects - Application Styles Entry
 *
 * Best practice for application styles is to create a foundational set of
 * component and utility styles themed by a single set of theme variables.
 * Application components can then be composed of the base component styles,
 * utility styles, and component styles.
 */

/*
 * --- Variables setup ---
 *
 * The same set of theme variables should be used for theming Componentry and
 * application components in order to create consistent application theming. For
 * convenience, the webpack configurations enable importing the theme variables
 * into any component style file with `@import 'theme';`
 */
@import './styles/theme';

/*
 * --- Componentry styles ---
 *
 * Componentry includes a browser reboot, component styles and utility styles.
 */
@import '~componentry/styles/componentry';

/*
 * --- Application styles ---
 *
 * Application styles should be used sparingly and cover general styling needs.
